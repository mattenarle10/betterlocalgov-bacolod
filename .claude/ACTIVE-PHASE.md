## Recent Fixes (Jan 11, 2026)

### ✅ Service Category Routing Fixed

**Commits:** b44aa45, 40e1af1

**Issues Fixed:**

- Transportation and Public Safety cards not showing on /services page

- Added categories to services.yaml and yamlLoader.ts categoryIndexMap

**All 12 categories now working:**

## Missing Content Categories

### Categories WITHOUT Bacolod-Specific Files Yet:

1. **Agriculture & Fisheries** (0/4 files) - seeds, veterinary, training, equipment
2. **Disaster Preparedness** (0/3 files) - drills, evacuation, early warning
3. **Environment** (0/2 files) - clean-up drives, illegal logging reporting
4. **Housing & Land Use** (0/3 files) - socialized housing, zoning, relocation
5. **Infrastructure & Public Works** (0/4 files) - damaged roads, water supply, public facilities

**Note:** These have index.yaml configs but no actual content files (.md). They show generic descriptions on the website.
