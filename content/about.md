# About BetterBacolod

BetterBacolod is a community project to make Bacolod City government information more accessible, accurate, and easy to find.

## Our Mission

We believe every Bacolodnon deserves easy access to information about:

- Government services and how to access them
- City officials and how to contact them
- Requirements for permits, IDs, and other documents

## How This Works

This website compiles publicly available information from official government sources and presents it in a user-friendly format.

**This is not an official government website.** For official transactions, always visit the actual government offices or their official websites.
