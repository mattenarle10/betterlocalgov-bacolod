## 5) Tips for Households

- Keep a **separate box** for batteries, bulbs, and small electronics.
- Do not break bulbs or dismantle devices — this increases risk of contamination.
- Join **barangay or school e-waste drives** regularly to avoid stockpiling.
- Encourage neighbors to **bundle requests together** — barangays often schedule collection faster for group requests.
